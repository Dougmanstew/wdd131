            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="images/douglas_stewart_profile.webp" alt="Douglas Stewart">

            <p>Growing up, family time at my house usually meant busting out the cards for a little game called Screwy Louie (a variation on Rummy). That's when my love for card, board, 
               and other tabletop games started. It’s also when I learned that nobody talks more smack than my mother. Seriously, she’s a pro.</p>
            
            <p>My interest in board games was increased by an order of magnitude in 2003 when a friend introduced me to a homemade copy of Settlers of Catan. At the time, 
               we were living in Japan and couldn’t find the game anywhere. He solved the problem by making a copy with supplies from a local craft store. One play was all 
               it took before I was off to purchase materials for a copy of my own.</p>

            <p>In more recent years, the tabletop hobby has served to help me develop deeper relationships with my wife and children, make incredible new friends (like Meeple Nation), 
               and improve some of my socially awkward habits (probably...maybe).</p>
                
            <p>In 2019, I converted a portion of our basement into a game room that my kids nicknamed “The DIG.” It’s short for Doug’s Institute of Games, and our 
               family hosts regular game groups there several times a week. Whether we’re populating a habitat full of high scoring wildlife, fending off an alien 
               invasion, or defeating the Dragon of Icespire Peak, everyone has a seat at our table (especially if you bring snacks)!</p>
